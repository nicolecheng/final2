<Project name> That 80s Game
This is a series of terminal-based 80s games.
The user will be able to make an account to keep track of high scores and stats
(or the high scores and the names will be displayed like in arcade games).

Development Log
-05/11/16: We decided on a project idea and the games that would be included.
-05/12/16: Start of README.md -- putting together the actual plan.

Project plan/outline including your goals prioritized by importance and chronology 
(things to do + things already done)
Things to do:
	- individual games (for demo)
		- which games are we going to recreate?
		- tetris: create class of shapes, user terminal input / controls, score keeping
		- pacman: series of boards, class of pacman and other little monster thingies
		- space invaders: class of alien ships, damage/score records, shooting
		- nintendogs: def need to keep track of user's dog and whatnot
		- pingpong: AI of some sort?
		- pinball: utilize physics! perhaps a simplified board with less controls
	- a welding factor for the various components
	- mechanism to output scores and names into a file
	- user accounts
	- powerups and cheat codes
Things already done:
	- zilch
