 That 80s Game <br>
This is a series of terminal-based 80s games. <br>
The user will be able to make an account to keep track of high scores and stats <br>
(or the high scores and the names will be displayed like in arcade games). <br><br>

Development Log <br><ul>
    <li>
      05/11/16: We decided on a project idea and the games that would be included.
    </li>
    <li>
      05/12/16: Start of README.md -- putting together the actual plan.
    </li>
    <li>
      05/14/16: Noah - began Pong, mainly working on interaction with the terminal as well as frequently updating (animation)
    </li>
    <li>
      05/15/16: Noah - actually worked on Pong - player's paddle movement works, need to add in ball movement + physics as well as enemy AI
    </li>
    <li>
      05/15/16: Nicole - got through most of Snake; need to make it a run with interactive controls
    </li>
    <li>
      05/16/16: Nicole - snake working; need to make snake grow create tutorial / game over pages
    </li>
    <li>
      05/16/16: We came up with a rad team name.
    </li>
    <li>
      05/16/16: Noah - still need to work on synchronizing visual with internal
    </li>
    <li>
      05/17/16: Noah - fixed wait function to not actually stop the game, need to place it correctly to sync visual and internal
    </li>
    <li>
      05/20/16: Nicole - started tutorial program's structure and storyline of the game
    </li>
    <li>
      05/21/16: Nicole - wrote beginning segment of the tutorial (up until the character reaches the snake game)
    </li>
    <li>
       05/22/16: Nicole - added a lot more to the tutorial to include 2 games, and I added a trivia segment.
     </li>
     <li>
       05/22/16: Noah - began working on platformer, obstacles not working but player jumping works
     </li>
     <li>
       05/23/16: Noah - worked on platformer, obstacles moving but getting sort of confused in terms of their positions (stopping randomly). To do: make it so that it doesn't queue up input commands on terminal (i.e. the w key to jump) so you can only do it once per frame, aka 10 times per second
     </li>
 </ul><br><br>

 Project plan/outline including your goals prioritized by importance and chronology <br>
 (things to do + things already done)<br>
 Things to do: <br><ul><li>
	 individual games (for demo)<li>
		 which games are we going to recreate?</li><li>
		 tetris: create class of shapes, user terminal input / controls, score keeping </li><li>
		 pacman: series of boards, class of pacman and other little monster thingies</li><li>
		 space invaders: class of alien ships, damage/score records, shooting</li><li>
		 nintendogs: def need to keep track of user's dog and whatnot</li><li>
		 pingpong: AI of some sort?</li><li>
		 pinball: utilize physics! perhaps a simplified board with less controls</li></li><li>
	 a welding factor for the various components</li><li>
	 mechanism to output scores and names into a file</li><li>
	 user accounts</li><li>
	 powerups and cheat codes</li>
 </ul><br>
 Things already done:<br><ul>
